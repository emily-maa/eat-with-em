        <p>Hi! I'm so glad you're here. I'm Emily and I am a student at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science
            with a minor in UX Design. This website is a product of that blend, as I wanted to create a cozy corner to showcase
            my collection of tasty and nutritious recipes. </p>
        
        <p>Being a college student myself, I understand the juggling act of schedules, which is why I've curated these recipes -
            to offer a helping hand in preparing nourishing meals even when time istight.</p>
        
        <p>In the whirlwind of university days, dedicating time to cooking nutritious meals can feel like a bit of a hassle.
            That's
            where this platform comes in, a place to find quick, satisfying recipe. Whether you're a seasoned cook or just
            starting
            out,I hope you find something here to spark your culinary creativity.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey!</p>
